Hate Speech Detection using Machine Learning

Overview:
Built a text classification model using machine learning
Preprocessed text using tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming
Evaluated the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
Developed an interactive web app using Streamlit
Organized into modular scripts: app.py, preprocessing.py, and train_model.py
